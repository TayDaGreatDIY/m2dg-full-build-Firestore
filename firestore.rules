/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the M2DG application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data,
 * allows public read access to shared content like court information and feed posts,
 * and uses shared access patterns for conversations.  Authorization decisions
 * are made independently at each level, minimizing `get()` calls and maximizing
 * performance and security.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /feed_posts/{postId}: Community feed posts, publicly readable but owner-controlled for writes.
 * - /courts/{courtId}: Court information, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/training_sessions/{sessionId}: Training sessions, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /conversations/{conversationId}: Direct message conversations, access controlled by memberIds array.
 * - /conversations/{conversationId}/chat_messages/{messageId}: Chat messages within conversations, access inherited from parent conversation.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data and training sessions.
 * - Feed posts and courts are publicly readable but writes are restricted to owners.
 * - Conversations are private, with access granted to members listed in the `memberIds` array.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed; only individual user profiles can be read.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Feed posts include `userId` and `courtId` to avoid `get()` calls for authorization.
 * - Conversations include a `memberIds` array to enable direct access control without additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data (profiles, training sessions) is stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Public data (courts, feed posts) is stored in top-level collections.
